✈️ Missed Flight Explanation & Rebooking Assistant
A smart NLP-based tool to classify complaints and assist passengers with suitable rebooking options.

📌 Overview
This app helps passengers who have missed their flights by analyzing their complaint messages. It identifies who is at fault (Passenger, Airline, or External Factors), provides a short explanation, and suggests a suitable rebooking action.

Built using:

🧠 Logistic Regression NLP model

🌐 Streamlit for web UI

🗂️ Custom dataset of complaint texts

🧠 Features
Classifies complaints into:

✈️ Airline fault

🧍 Passenger fault

🌧️ External factors

Provides rebooking suggestions like:

Free rebooking (if airline at fault)

Paid rebooking (if passenger at fault)

Alternative helpdesk advice (for external causes)

🛠️ How It Works
User types in a reason for missing their flight

The app uses a trained Logistic Regression model to predict the fault type

A custom response is shown to guide the user for next steps
